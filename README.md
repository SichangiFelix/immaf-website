# initial review
- Used Bootstrap 4 (obviously, duh) for the website.
- Not sure if the media queries are the problem with the responsiveness and will continue to work on this during the next few weeks.
- Display is a major concern: does not render too well on screens with a width below 350 I guess;
The JQuery doesn't work under http/https on a desktop screen apparently, and I don't even know what that means;
the navbar is inconsistent, working on some phones and not working in others. This shouldn't too much of a problem as I'm planning to change it entirely;
The display works really well on screens of widths between 1028 and 460...IN PORTRAIT MODE!!!. It's a complete disaster in landscape mode! *sobs
